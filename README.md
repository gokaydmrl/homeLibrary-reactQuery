# homeLibrary-reactQuery!

   In this full stack project, I have used React, Express, PostgreSQL database and Prisma ORM technologies. For the CRUD operations, I have used React Query which is async state management library. Using it has given me a great experience and confidence since it requires coding custom hooks which have a great significance in React to be able to code clean. 
   I have also used React Router and a lot of React hooks.
   
   For the styling the app, I decided to use Bootstrap because it is one of the CSS library I have the most familiarity with.
   
   On the backend side, I created an Express server. I have coded routers and controllers in a clean and understandable way. Using PostgreSQL which is a relational database has provided me great experience in creating tables. Thanks to it, I have learned fundementals of SQL and creating relations between user and books.
   I also used JWT (json web tokens) for authentication.
   I also handle errors from both backend and frontend and send them to the user.
   
   I am still working on my project to make it cleaner and better in performance.
   I also hope to deploy it as soon as possible to make it accessible for everyone. There are some screenshots of the app.
